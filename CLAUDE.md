# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**ContractPro** — AI-powered contract review platform for the Russian legal jurisdiction (ГК РФ). The system analyzes contracts to identify legal/financial risks, checks mandatory conditions, generates recommendations for improving wording, and provides summaries for non-legal users.

The **Document Processing domain is fully implemented** — complete application code (domain model, engine layer, application services, infrastructure adapters, ingress/egress layers, app wiring) with 936 tests passing across 30 packages. Other domains remain in the architecture/requirements phase.

## Domain Architecture

The system is decomposed into 8 domains communicating via event-driven architecture through a message broker:

1. **Document Processing (DP)** — stateless. PDF ingestion, OCR, text extraction, structure extraction, semantic tree building, version diff. **Fully implemented** — code in `DocumentProcessing/development/`.
2. **Legal Intelligence Core (LIC)** — stateless. The "legal brain": contract type classification, risk analysis, risk explanations, recommended wording, risk profile calculation, summary/report generation. Reads artifacts from Document Management (not directly from DP).
3. **Legal Knowledge Base** — stateful. Source of legal norms (ГК РФ) for training LIC neural networks.
4. **Organization Policy Management** — stateful. Client-specific templates, policies, checklists, strictness settings.
5. **Reporting Engine** — stateless. Transforms LIC outputs into user-facing reports (summary, detailed report, version comparison report, PDF/DOCX export).
6. **Document Management (DM)** — stateful. Document versioning, metadata, artifact storage (OCR results, semantic trees, reports).
7. **User & Organization Management** — stateful. Auth, users, roles, permissions, org bindings.
8. **Payment Processing** — stateful. Service payment handling.

### Architecture Pattern

Hexagonal (ports & adapters):
- **Inbound ports** (`port/inbound.go`): `ProcessingCommandHandler`, `ComparisonCommandHandler`, `DMResponseHandler`
- **Engine ports** (`port/engine.go`): `InputValidatorPort`, `SourceFileFetcherPort`, `TextExtractionPort`, `StructureExtractionPort`, `SemanticTreeBuilderPort`, `OCRProcessorPort`, `VersionComparisonPort`
- **Outbound ports** (`port/outbound.go`): `TempStoragePort`, `OCRServicePort`, `EventPublisherPort`, `DMArtifactSenderPort`, `DMTreeRequesterPort`, `IdempotencyStorePort`, `ConcurrencyLimiterPort`, `DMConfirmationAwaiterPort`, `PendingResponseRegistryPort`, `DLQPort`
- **Domain errors** (`port/errors.go`): typed `DomainError` with error codes, retryable flag, and `errors.Is/As` unwrapping

### Pipelines

**Processing Pipeline:** Command → Validate → Fetch PDF → OCR (if scanned) → Extract Text → Extract Structure → Build Semantic Tree → Send Artifacts to DM → Await Confirmation → Publish Completion

**Comparison Pipeline:** Command → Request Semantic Trees from DM → Await Both → Compare → Send Diff to DM → Await Confirmation → Publish Completion

## Build, Test, Lint

All commands run from `DocumentProcessing/development/`:

```bash
make build          # go build ./cmd/dp-worker/
make test           # go test ./...
make lint           # go vet ./...
make docker-build   # docker build with git-based tag
```

## Deployment

Docker Compose files are at the project root:

```bash
# Local development (builds from source)
docker compose up --build

# Production (pre-built image)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

See `DocumentProcessing/architecture/deployment.md` for the full deployment guide.

## Configuration

Config loads from `DP_`-prefixed env vars. See `DocumentProcessing/architecture/configuration.md` for the full reference.

**Required env vars** (service won't start without them):
- `DP_BROKER_ADDRESS` — RabbitMQ address
- `DP_KVSTORE_ADDRESS` — Redis address
- `DP_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, `DP_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `DP_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`, `DP_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` — Yandex Object Storage
- `DP_OCR_ENDPOINT`, `DP_OCR_API_KEY`, `DP_OCR_FOLDER_ID` — Yandex Cloud Vision OCR

**Key defaults:** max file 20 MB, max 100 pages, 120s job timeout, 5 concurrent jobs, OCR 10 RPS.

For local dev, create a `.env` file in `DocumentProcessing/development/`. Already-set env vars take precedence.

## Key Technical Decisions (Document Processing v1)

- Input format: **PDF only** (DOC/DOCX planned for later)
- Compile-time interface checks: `var _ Port = (*Impl)(nil)` pattern throughout
- Domain errors carry machine-readable codes and retryable flags for orchestrator decision-making
- Structure extraction uses Russian-language regex patterns for sections (Раздел), clauses (Пункт), appendices (Приложение), party details (Реквизиты)
- Text normalization: Unicode NFC + garbage character removal (C0/C1 control, zero-width, BOM, etc.)
- Version comparison: ID-based node matching with three-pass diff (removed, added, modified/moved)
- Deterministic diff output: sorted by Type+NodeID/Path; empty slices (not nil) for JSON `[]`
- Inter-domain communication: event-driven via RabbitMQ
- Dead letter queue for failed messages (post-mortem analysis)
- Graceful shutdown: ordered teardown (readiness → broker → HTTP → KV → observability)
- Constraints: ~1000 contracts/day initial load
